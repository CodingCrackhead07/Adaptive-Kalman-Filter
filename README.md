Adaptive Kalman Filter Implementation for Unchanging Velocity Model (CV) in Python

A key answer to the current difficulties in dynamic system modelling and state estimation is the use of Dynamic Kalman Filtering for the Unchanging Speed Model (CV) in Python. For vehicle navigation tasks, Kalman Filter (KF) is commonly utilized, especially for smoothing vehicle trajectories. Specifically for dynamic systems with linear motion, the Python implementation of an Adaptive Kalman Filter for the Unchanging speed model is a noteworthy development in state estimation techniques. Assuming a steady and constant speed across time, the Unchanging speed model is a basic depiction of motion. Creating a dynamic model of the target's motion requires employing the Kalman filter for tracking moving objects. An unchanging speed model, which assumes that the velocity remains constant throughout a sample interval, is the most used dynamic model. This model's adaptability, efficiency, and simplicity have led to its widespread usage.
